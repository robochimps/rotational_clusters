# Work log

[x] Implement rovibrations for H2S

[x] Compute all states up to $J=60$, test against TROVE/DVR3D, plot energy level diagram for cluster states

[x] Implement rotational density, 2D in $(\theta,\phi)$, plot densities for cluster states.

[x] Add vibrational matrix elements of spin-rotation

[ ] Add vibrational matrix elements of dipole moment, electric field gradient (for $\text{D}_2\text{S}$ molecule)

[x] Implement spin-rotation interaction.

[ ] Implement quadrupole interaction.

[ ] Compute hyperfine components of cluster states.

[ ] Implement dipole interactione

[ ] Implement nuclear quadrupole interaction (for $\text{D}_2\text{S}$ molecule)

[ ] Compute Stark effect for rovibrational and hypefine cluster states

[ ] Implement spin-density, complute with and without Stark effect

[ ] Improve performance of J=0 basis using GPU implementation ideas from `flows`

[ ] Integrate with `pyhami` when it's ready
