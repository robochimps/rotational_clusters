[x] Implement rovibrations for H2S

[*] Compute all states up to $J=60$, test against TROVE, plot energy level diagram for cluster states

[*] Implement rotational density, both 3D in ($x,y,z$) and 2D in $(\theta,\phi)$, plot densities for cluster states

[ ] Add vibrational matrix elements of dipole moment, spin-rotation, electric field gradient (for $\text{D}_2\text{S}$ molecule)

[ ] Implement spin-rotation, and optionally quadrupole, interaction. Compute hyperfine components of cluster states

[ ] Implement Stark effect. Compute Stark effect for rovibrational and hypefine cluster states

[ ] Implement spin-density, complute with and without Stark effect


[ ] Improve performance of J=0 basis using GPU implementation ideas from `flows`

[ ] Integrate with `pyhami` when it's ready
